Crime Colnames to discard for final merged model:
------------------------------------------

Censustract, Lat, Lon, Location, Month, FinalZip(has errors)

Crime Colnames to keep for merged model:
----------------------------------
Year, ZipChar, Number of crimes


Crime Colnames to add for merged model:
---------------------------------
Number of violent crimes, number of non-violent, number of  white-collar/ blue-collar crimes
IsViolent? Is Non-Violent? Is it white-collar? Is it Blue-collar? etc
