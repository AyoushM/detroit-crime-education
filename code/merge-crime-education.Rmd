## Examining Crime with Zips Data frame 
Year, ZIP, No of crimes, No of schools in district, Mean Graduation Rate, Mean Dropput rate, Total graduates, total drop outs
```{r}
#setwd("~/Projects/Detroit Project")
crime <- read.csv("crimewithzips.csv")
colnames(crime)
```
[1] "X"                  "ROWNUM"             "CASEID"             "ADDRESS"           
[5] "CATEGORY"           "OFFENSEDESCRIPTION" "INCIDENTDATE"       "HOUR"

Crime Colnames to discard for final merged model:
------------------------------------------
X, Rownum, CaseId, Address, Precinct, OffenseDescription, IncidentDate, Hour, Category*, Neighbourhood, SCA
Censustract, Lat, Lon, Location, Month, FinalZip(has errors)

Crime Colnames to keep for merged model:
----------------------------------
Year, ZipChar, Number of crimes


Crime Colnames to add for merged model:
---------------------------------
Number of violent crimes, number of non-violent, number of  white-collar/ blue-collar crimes
IsViolent? Is Non-Violent? Is it white-collar? Is it Blue-collar? etc


## Creating simplified Crime model
```{r}
keep = c("YEAR", "ZIP_CHAR")
simple.crime=crime[keep]
colnames(simple.crime)

simple.crime$NUM_CRIMES = 1
colnames(simple.crime)
head(simple.crime)

simple.crime=aggregate(simple.crime$NUM_CRIMES, by=list(simple.crime$YEAR, simple.crime$ZIP_CHAR), FUN=sum)
colnames(simple.crime)

colnames(simple.crime) = c("YEAR", "ZIP", "NUM_CRIMES")

head(simple.crime)
summary(simple.crime)

plot(simple.crime)

#Let's see how crimes vary across the years
plot(simple.crime$NUM_CRIMES ~simple.crime$YEAR)

#Wouldn't it be better as a violin plot?
library(ggplot2)

#Change the input X variable (YEAR) to a factor from int
simple.crime$YEAR = as.factor(simple.crime$YEAR)

# Change violin plot line colors by groups
p<-ggplot(simple.crime, aes(x=simple.crime$YEAR, y=simple.crime$NUM_CRIMES, color=simple.crime$YEAR)) +
  geom_violin(trim=FALSE)
p + stat_summary(fun.y=median, geom="point", size=2, color="red") + stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point", shape=23, size=2)


# Change box plot line colors by groups
p<-ggplot(simple.crime, aes(x=simple.crime$YEAR, y=simple.crime$NUM_CRIMES, color=simple.crime$YEAR)) +  geom_boxplot()
p


#Re-order number of crimes per year , with zips

## Examining Education with Zips Data frame 
Year, ZIP, No of crimes, No of schools in district, Mean Graduation Rate, Mean Dropput rate, Total graduates, total drop outs, 
```{r}
setwd("~/Projects/Detroit Project/detroit-crime-education/data/clean/Education")
education <- read.csv("clean-education-with-zips.csv")
colnames(education)
```
 The returned Column Names are:
 
 [1] "X"                "ENROLL_YEAR"      "SCHOOL_NAME"      "COHORT_GRAD_YEAR" "GRAD_YEAR"        "NUM_COHORT"      
 [7] "NUM_GRADUATES"    "NUM_DROPOUTS"     "GRAD_RATE"        "DROP_RATE"        "ZIP"              "LATITUDE"        
[13] "LONGITUDE"
 

Education Colnames to discard for merged model:
------------------------------------------


Education Colnames to keep for merged model:
----------------------------------
GRAD_YEAR, COHORT_GRAD_YEAR, NUM_DROPOUTS, NUM_GRADUTES


Education Colnames to add for merged model:
---------------------------------
Number of Schools 


## Creating simplified Education model
```{r}

colnames(education)
education$NUM_SCHOOLS= 1
colnames(education)

#Can remove individual school identifiers like school name, latitude and longitude
#Need to look at Zip code level data per year
education  #615 rows

#Having aggregated data for Enroll Year and Zip Code
keep1= c("ENROLL_YEAR", "COHORT_GRAD_YEAR","NUM_SCHOOLS","NUM_COHORT", "NUM_GRADUATES", "NUM_DROPOUTS", "ZIP")
edu.enroll = education[keep1]
edu.enroll=aggregate(edu.enroll, by=list(edu.enroll$ENROLL_YEAR, edu.enroll$ZIP), FUN=sum)
edu.enroll
head(edu.enroll)  #421 rows


#Something weird in the last two rows :( Check out why the zip code is coming as 96480, must be some doubling of the data!

#Having aggregated data for Graduation Year and Zip Code
keep2= c("GRAD_YEAR","NUM_SCHOOLS","NUM_COHORT", "NUM_GRADUATES", "NUM_DROPOUTS", "ZIP")
edu.grad= education[keep2]
edu.grad=aggregate(edu.grad, by=list(edu.grad$GRAD_YEAR, edu.grad$ZIP), FUN=sum)
edu.grad #332 rows

#Last Record is weird!!!!! Must check. TODO
